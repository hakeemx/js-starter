# Javascript Starter

My goal of creating this starter pack was to be as simple and minimal as possible to get started and allow other modules to be added if needed. Hot reloading is installed by default so there's no need to (CTRL+SHIFT+R) to reload everytime you save a file so it should save a tremendous amount of time off your development.

# Features

This starter pack includes support for ES6, comes with Hot Reload installed to avoid constant page refreshes when making file changes, ReactJS is also included.

## Installation

Run the 3 commands below:

1. "npm install".
2. "npm install webpack -g" 
3. "npm install webpack-dev-server -g"

# Getting Started

To get started open the terminal or command line and run "npm run dev" to start the server. 

## After Installing

Open http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server in your browser to run a local server. 

## Tips

To ensure your bundle file gets compiled I recommend running 2 instances of your terminal(Have 2 command prompts or terminals open).

1. In terminal 1 run "webpack --watch"
2. In terminal 2 run "npm run dev"

This will ensure that your bundle file gets updated and you always see your latest file changes in real time.
