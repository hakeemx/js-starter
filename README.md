# Javascript Starter

My goal of creating this starter pack was to be as simple and minimal as possible to get started and allow other modules to be added if needed. Hot reloading is installed by default so there's no need to (CTRL+SHIFT+R) to reload everytime you save a file so it should save a tremendous amount of time off your development.

# Features
This starter pack includes support for ES6, comes with Hot Reload installed to avoid constant page refreshes when making file changes, ReactJS is also included.

## Installation

Run the 3 commands below:

1."npm install".
2."npm install webpack -g" 
3."npm install webpack-dev-server -g"

#Getting Started
To get started open the terminal or command line and run "npm run dev" to start the server. 

After installing...Open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ and your page will refresh everytime you make a change to the javascript file(Store in src/js by default).
