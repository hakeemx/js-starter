#Javascript hot-reload starter pack

My goal of creating this starter pack was to be as simple and minimal as possible to get started and allow other modules to be added if needed. Hot reloading is installed by default so there's no need to (CTRL+SHIFT+R) to reload everytime you save a file so it should save a tremendous amount of time off your development.

#Features
Javascript's latest update(ES6) is also supported and will be transpiled automatically to regular Vanilla JS which can be read by the browser after each save by Babel(Javascript transpiler). Just add your Javascript in the "src/js/scripts.js file and babel will take care of the rest. ReactJS and redux is also available to use if needs be.

#Installation
If you have yarn installed run "yarn" and this will install all the required dependencies. If not then you can install dependencies by running "npm install".

#Getting Started
To get started open the terminal or command line and run "npm run dev" to start the server. 
After installing...Open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ and your page will refresh everytime you make a change to the javascript file(Store in src/js by default).
